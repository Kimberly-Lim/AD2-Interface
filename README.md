This Python code streamlines the use of the Analog Discovery 2 device by enabling automatic data collection with ease. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time visualization of each measured interval, ensuring quick validation of processed data.

Key capabilities include:

- Automatic and Manual Data Collection: Choose between manual measurements or scheduled data collection at set intervals.
- Data Export: Easily export collected data to a .csv file for further analysis or record-keeping.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies interaction and enhances productivity with an intuitive GUI.
This tool is designed to make data collection and validation seamless, helping users efficiently harness the capabilities of the Analog Discovery 2.


How to run AnalogDiscovery2.py Code:

Windows/Mac 
1.	Install Python (I used 3.11.8)  
a.	Should come with PIP to install these libraries. You can use the command in the terminal “pip install *library*”

b.	Install Pandas Library
    Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
    
c. Install matplotlib Library
    Documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html
    
d. Install numpy 
    Documentation: https://numpy.org/install/
    
3.	Install Waveforms 
   a.	https://digilent.com/reference/test-and-measurement/analog-discovery-2/getting-started-guide
   b.	Open “WaveForms SDK” 
 
4.	Open the code in the Analog Discovery 2 SDK folder “py”  
   a.	This allows the code to run with the analog discovery 2 because it has all of the libraries and paths 
   b.	“Impedance_Data_Collection” folder should be created here when collecting data
