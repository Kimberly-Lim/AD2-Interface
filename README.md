How to run AnalogDiscovery2.py Code:
Code works with the device Analog Discovery 2 
I used Visual Studio Code, but you can use any IDE you prefer, for example IDLE 

Windows/Mac 
1.	Install Python (I used 3.11.8)  
a.	Should come with PIP to install these libraries. You can use the command in the terminal “pip install *library*”
b.	Install Pandas Library
    Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
c. Install matplotlib Library
    Documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html
d. Install numpy 
    Documentation: https://numpy.org/install/
2.	Install Waveforms 
   a.	https://digilent.com/reference/test-and-measurement/analog-discovery-2/getting-started-guide
   b.	Open “WaveForms SDK” 
 
3.	Open the code in the Analog Discovery 2 SDK folder “py”  
   a.	This allows the code to run with the analog discovery 2 because it has all of the libraries and paths 
   b.	“Impedance_Data_Collection” folder should be created here when collecting data
